# NeetCode150Practice

2 pointer approach - Mainly used for reducing our time complexity from Big O(n) to linear n i.e O(n^2) -> O(n)
Sliding window approach 


HashSet:- A Set is a data structure that maintains a collection of unique elements. It provides constant-time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion, making it a suitable choice for tracking unique characters in a string.

The sliding window approach allows us to scan through the string once (linear time complexity) while keeping track of the longest substring without repeating characters. It's an optimal strategy for this problem as it avoids unnecessary repeated computations.
